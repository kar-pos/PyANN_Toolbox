# PyANN Toolbox - ultimate solution for neural modeling
PyANN Toolbox is an unified engine for different neural network-based models. It has a consistent interface for a total of 4 ANN models

## Files description
* [Release](https://github.com/kar-pos/PelletCatalystsANN/releases/tag/v1.0.0) version of App with full GUI (see screenshot above), recommended for most users.
* Release.zip - it is a mirror of above attached release
* Resources - this folder includes raw models (without GUI) of all ANNs used in the Toolbox. The models are optimized to run under C# language. Onnx releases can also be use in any compatible environment.
